HeartDisease dataset from Kaggle is used.
Categorical attributes are One Hot Encoded.
RandomForestClassifier with max depth of 8 is used to train the model giving Sensitivity of 0.903 and Specificity of 0.76.
By using Permutation Importance method it can be observed that important features like thalassemia_reversable defect,num_major_vessels etc are
the one which affects the prediction greatly.
SHAP values suggest that number of blood vessels in the heart of a person is really important feature contributing for heart attack, as it's low values
are bad.
